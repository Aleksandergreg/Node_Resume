      <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold mb-6">Git</h1>

      <p class="mb-4">
        Git is a version control system that, cut down to the bone,  helps us as developers to keep track of the changes we made to our code over time. Imagine it like this, you want to make a change to your project, but you are afraid it will make your project break, so you save your project as Project_v1, so you are sure you have a working version. Then you implement your new feature, so now you save your project as Project_v2. This would solve the issue, but it quickly gets messy, think of you having projects called Project_final and Project_final_final and so on.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        It also allows us to collaborate and share our code with group members, and other people who would be interested in our code. Because of the version control it also allows us to play around with new features, without having to be afraid of breaking our application, as we can make roll back to earlier commits in the projects, create branches, so we don’t break the code that exists on either our development or production branch.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        The most important Git commands to be able to work with Git on GitHub or any other cloud-based platform for version control and collaboration, using any kind of terminal:
      </p>

      <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Cloning a repository:</p>
      <pre class="bg-gray-800 text-white p-4 rounded mb-4"><code class="language-git">git clone &lt;url-to-the-repository-you-would-like-to-work-or-collaborate-on&gt;</code></pre>

      <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Initialise Git(if your project is not already a Git repository, not needed if you have cloned):</p>
      <pre class="bg-gray-800 text-white p-4 rounded mb-4"><code class="language-git">git init</code></pre>

      <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Stage the changes:</p>
      <pre class="bg-gray-800 text-white p-4 rounded mb-4 whitespace-pre"><code class="language-git">git add .

git add -A</code></pre>

      <p class="mb-4">
        git add . will stage all your new and modified files, but does not stage deletions, in your current directory, e.g what directory you have cd’ed in in your project.
      </p>

      <p class="mb-4">
        git add -A will stage all the changes you have made to your project, including deletions, no matter which path you are on in your project.
      </p>

      <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Create a snapshot of your changes:</p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        With the git add command, we have actually not saved the changes anywhere, we have just told Git that it is these changes that we would like to continue with. To create a snapshot of your changes use this command:
      </p>
      <pre class="bg-gray-800 text-white p-4 rounded mb-4"><code class="language-git">git commit -m "a good commit message here"</code></pre>

      <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Connecting to a GitHub repository:</p>
      <p class="mb-4">
        With the git add and git commit command, we have now saved our changes to our local git history. Now we would like to push it to a remote repository, for a better overview and being able to collaborate with others. This is not needed if you have used the git clone command, as your local repository is already linked to the remote repository. This is done by the following command:
      </p>
      <pre class="bg-gray-800 text-white p-4 rounded mb-4"><code class="language-git">git remote add origin https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git</code></pre>

      <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Pushing the changes to GitHub:</p>
      <pre class="bg-gray-800 text-white p-4 rounded mb-4"><code class="language-git">git push -u origin main</code></pre>

      <p class="font-semibold mb-2">Pulling changes from GitHub:</p>
      <pre class="bg-gray-800 text-white p-4 rounded mb-4"><code class="language-git">git pull</code></pre>
    </main>
